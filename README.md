# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a Random Forest algorithm, it identifies customers likely to churn enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies effectively.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment-ready code

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, streamlit etc.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Patrick-Ko/customer-churn.git
    cd customer_churn
    ```

2. Run script to preprocess and train model:
    ```bash
    python customer_churn.py
    ```
